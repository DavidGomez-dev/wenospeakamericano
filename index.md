# Book "We No Speak Americano": The best immigration guide to living in the United States

### All information to study, work or live in the United States

We No Speak Americano is the definitive guide you need to **study, work or live in the United States**. It is probably the most complete work that has been written about all the procedures, documents, steps and tricks to succeed in the country. It collects more than six years of research and personal experiences of David Gomez and Laura Carreño, who have successfully advised dozens of people to **achieve their dream** of emigrating to the USA.

In a casual but objective tone, the multitude of concepts, norms and peculiarities of the American country are explained. It is difficult to find information so well structured and easy to read in other sources. Mixing **funny anecdotes** and personal reflections, it is possible to understand the curious American society, a model being praised from the outside but that is also full of shadows.

![Buy We No Speak Americano book in Amazon](/assets/images/we-no-speak-americano-book.jpg){: .align-left}

Concepts such as visa F, OPT, _Social Security_, _Credit History_, _Sexual Harassment_, taxes, _the Employment Permit_ or the importance of attorneys, are treated with precision and simplicity.

Its more than 250 pages are structured into 22 chapters and 5 sections: visas and legal documents to be in the country, procedures to study in the US and work later, finding employment and succeed in it, typical issues to live such as finding a house, car, or dealing with banks or taxes and, finally, coping with the return to the country of origin.

The text is prepared to support legislative changes of each political cycle, deepening into the facts that explain the rise of nationalism and discovering the closest future.

A book that will accompany you from **before passing the border until you are one more American**.

Thanks to their work in the Trade Commission of Spain and several multinational companies, they have helped numerous people to solve their questions about how to **study, work or live in the United States**.

Now summarize all that research and experience work so that you have the necessary information **to succeed in the American country**.

### Why is it difficult to live in the United States?

text extracted from the book **We No Speak Americano**

There are different visas that allow you to go to the United States depending on the activity you are going to do. Staying for short periods for tourism or business is simple, remaining for longer periods to study is not a problem either, but working usually tends to be more complicated. There is a saying for **permanent residency** that it is only achieved through one of the three "Ls" (_Labor, Love or Lottery_).

American companies can only hire individuals who are authorized to work, otherwise they would be hiring undocumented workers and risking significant fines. It is also illegal to hire a worker without verifying their **authorization to work** through the Form I-9 or the _e-verify_ program. It's also against the law to subcontract jobs to other companies that have undocumented workers. As laws in the United States are respected and enforced, employers have a strong aversion and fear of hiring anyone without permission, especially in larger companies and more professional positions. Additionally, many professions require or recommend American licenses or certifications in order to practice, such as doctors, lawyers, or engineers.

In order for an American company to hire a foreigner, either they must already have permission (such as with OPT, _Green Card_, etc.) or they **must sponsor them** for an H visa (the most common), O visa, J visa, or Green Card. But this process is costly, lengthy (it can take months), and risky (the visa may not be granted, for example, because it falls within the H lottery). Foreign companies operating in the USA have some more options with the E or L visas.

Therefore, except for very exclusive positions or in cases where there is a shortage of such professionals, American companies, in general, avoid sponsoring at all costs.

In many online job applications, they will directly ask if you have permission to work or if you need sponsorship. If so, it's likely that they won't even call you back. People who come with tourist visas to try for a few months really have almost no chance of being hired.

However, even though **the reality is harsh**, we have written this book to give you the keys and guide you towards the path that will give you the most options to **achieve your goal of living and working in the USA**.
