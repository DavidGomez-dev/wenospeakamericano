# Book "We No Speak Americano": The best guide to emigrate to the United States

### All information to study, work or live in the United States

We No American Speak is the definitive guide you need to study, work or live in the United States. It is probably the most complete work that has been written about all the procedures, documents, steps and tricks to be given to succeed in the country. It collects more than six years of research and personal experiences of David GÃ³mez and Laura CarreÃ±o, who have successfully advised dozens of people to get their dream of emigrating to the USA.

In a casual but objective tone, the multitude of concepts, norms and peculiarities of the American country are explained. It is difficult to find so much structured and so easy to read information.Mixed with funny anecdotes and personal reflections, it is put in context and it is possible to understand the curious American society, a model that praises from outside but that is full of shadows.

Concepts such as visa F, OPT, the social Security, the Credit History, the sexual Harrassment, the Taxes, the Employment Permit or the importance of the Attorneys, are treated with precision and simplicity.

Its more than 250 pages are structured in 22 chapters and 5 sections: visas and legal documents to be in the country, procedures to study in the US and work later, find employment and succeed in it, usual steps to live as find a house, car, caror deal with banks or taxes and, finally, face the return to the country of origin.

The text is prepared to support the foreseeable legislative changes of each political cycle, deepening the facts that explain the rise of nationalism and discovering the closest future.

### Why is it difficult to emigrate to the United States?

text extracted from the book We No Speak Americano

There are different visas that allow us to go to the United States depending on the activity to be done. Being short periods for tourism or businesses is simple, staying longer to study is not a problem, but, working, is usually much more complicated.There is a saying for permanent residence, which is achieved only by one of the three "L" (work, love or lottery).

American companies can only hire people who are authorized to work, if not, they would be hiring illegal and risking important fines. It is even illegal to hire a worker and that the company does not verify that it is authorized to work (with the form I-9 or the E-Verify program). It is also illegal to subcontract jobs to other companies that have illegal workers. And as laws in the United States are respected and enforced, employers have great aversion and fear of hiring anyone who does not have permission, the more the company is and the more professional is the position. In addition, in many professions, American licenses or certifications are necessary to be able to exercise, as doctors, lawyers or engineers.

For an American company to hire a foreigner, or he already has permission (with Opt, Green Card, etc.) or has to sponsor for an H (the most usual), or, J, or Green Card. But that process has costs, it is long (it can take months) and it is risky (the visa may not be granted, because it falls into the Lottery of the H, for example). Foreign companies have some more option with the Visa e or the L.

Therefore, except for very exclusive or that there is a lack of such professionals, American companies, in general, avoid sponsorizing at all costs.

In many online applications for jobs, they will ask you directly if you have permission to work or if you need sponsors.If so, do not even call you. People who come with tourism visas to try a few months have almost no option to be hired.

However, although the reality is hard, we have written this book to give you the keys and guide you towards the path that will give you more options to achieve your goal of living and working in the US.In the decision tree that is recorded in the book, the keys of each visa are summarized in a simple way.
