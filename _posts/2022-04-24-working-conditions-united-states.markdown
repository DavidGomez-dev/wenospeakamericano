Working conditions in the United States have nothing to do with those of other parts of the world.In this case, the legislation gives companies much more to manage the working conditions of employees.The fact that it is a very capitalist system and the absence of universal medical insurance leads to each company deciding to require its workers and how to compensate them.It is normal to negotiate salary, work schedule, vacation days, medical insurance or private pension (401k).

The general properties of the labor market are:

- Types of employee: There are two types of workers, workers per hour and contracted workers. As for workers per hour, every extra hour that the worker is completed, he is paid as if he had worked for an hour and a half. That is, if the salary per hour is 15 dollars an hour, for every extra hour that completes, 37.5 dollars will be paid. Contract workers, normally managers or senior positions, get extra salary if they get good results in their team.

- Performance review: Annual performance evaluations are applied in all workers, if the worker gets a positive balance, his salary rises automatically.This usually occurs in almost all cases.

- Employee's motivation/career plan: Career plans for employees are created, in which employment is evaluated, what requirements are necessary to obtain a labor promotion. If you meet the requirements and the position is free, you get the promotion even in just one year.

- Salary: Salaries are high, allow all expenses to be paid and the other whim is granted. In each state the minimum wage varies, thus in Los Angeles, since the cost of life is high, the minimum hour per hour is 2 dollars higher than average in the country.

- Benefits: Companies offer each worker a benefit plan according to the company policy. These benefits include medical insurance, 401k or retirement savings plan, pension plan, vacations or drops due to illness. It is something that is negotiated in the input conditions.

- Holidays: Each company decides how many days of vacation will give your worker, since at the national level, it is not mandatory to give vacations to the workers. However, in practically all jobs are offered vacation days. Holidays can be achieved later 6 months of work. However, in some states, the laws of the same State force a number of vacation days a year to employees.

- Low due to illness or a family member: each company decides how many days of illness will give its worker, since at the national level, it is not mandatory to give days of illness to the workers. In this case, 3 days due to illness are usually given a year. Although in some states it is mandatory to give 6.

- Contracts: In the United States there are no work contracts, but written agreements are signed in which the worker expresses that he wishes to work in that company for the time, that he accepts the working conditions and that in the case of renouncing theEmployment can do it freely when you want. In turn, the employer expresses that he accepts the employee as a worker, for a certain position, for full time (8 hours a day), partial (between 4 and 5 hours a day) or freelance. In this way, the employee can unsubscribe without warning period.

- Employment verification in the United States: When working in the United States, the employer usually verifies with the Department of Homeland Security that the employee can work legally in the United States. Thus, they avoid hiring illegal immigrants.
