# Making Your Move: An Insight into Obtaining a Green Card Through Investment in the USA

Obtaining a _(green card through investment)_ in the USA is a viable pathway for many potential immigrants. It offers an opportunity to live, work, and establish a prosperous life in the land of opportunities.

## What is a Green Card?

A **green card** is an identification card indicating the holder's status to live and work in the USA permanently. It's initially valid for 10 years and can be renewed.

## Through Which Path Can You Obtain a Green Card?

There are several pathways to obtaining a **green card**, but one of the less explored, yet lucrative routes, is _green card through investment_.

## Understanding Green Card Through Investment â€“ EB5 Visa

When we refer to _green card through investment_, it's essentially about the **EB-5 visa**. This program enables entrepreneurs (and their spouses and unmarried children under 21) to apply for a green card by investing a substantial amount in a commercial enterprise in the U.S and creating or preserving 10 full-time jobs for qualifying U.S workers.

## How to Get a Green Card Through Investment

Follow these steps for obtaining a _green card through investment_:

### 1. Determine Your Eligibility

You must be prepared to invest $1.8 million in a new commercial enterprise. However, if the investment is in a targeted employment area (rural area or area with high unemployment), the requirement drops to $900,000.

### 2. Select a Suitable Business Project

Find an existing or new commercial enterprise to invest in. This could range from a sole proprietorship to a publicly or privately owned corporation.

### 3. Begin Your Investment

Invest the required amount into the enterprise. You can do this directly or through a regional center.

### 4. Complete Your I-526 Petition

Submit Form I-526, Immigrant Petition by Alien Investor, demonstrating that you have met all the requirements.

### 5. Obtain Conditional Permanent Residency

If your I-526 petition is approved, you may apply for a conditional green card.

### 6. Apply for Removal of Conditions

After maintaining your investment for a two-year period, you must submit a Form I-829, Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions on Permanent Resident Status.

## Conclusion

While obtaining a _green card through investment_ is deeply rewarding, it's crucial to understand the process and responsibilities before you embark on your journey.

**Always remember:** The easier paths are not always the most worthwhile. Sometimes, it takes just a bit of courage and a significant investment to realize your American dream.
