  # How to Navigate the Labyrinth of Green Card Application in the USA

Getting settled in the USA is a dream of many, but the process of residency through applying for a green card can be complex and intimidating. In this how-to guide, we'll explain what you need to know about "how to apply for green card" in the most manageable way. 

## First Steps to Getting Your Green Card in the USA

Starting, of course, with 'how'. Applying for a green card, also known as the Permanent Resident Card, begins with determining your eligibility. You should fall into one of the categories listed under U.S. immigration law.

## The Categories

You could either apply for a green card through a relative, a job offer or employment, refugee status or another less common method â€“ something we'll break down in detail later.

## Determining the Category

Once you've determined "how" you'll be applying, the next step in "how to apply for green card" is by submitting a Green Card application, aka an Immigration Petition. 

For family-based applications, you'll need to complete Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative. For employment-based applications, your employer will need to complete Form I-140, Petition for Alien Worker.

## The Waiting Game

Once you've submitted the form, you play the waiting game. Applying for a green card can often involve a long wait time, especially with the extensive background checks that need to take place. 

## The Interview and Fingerprinting

Green card applicants will be asked to appear for fingerprinting at a specific time and place. Post this, an interview will be scheduled.

## Issuing of the Green Card

If approved, you'll either receive your green card by mail or have to visit a local office to pick it up.

That's it! That's 'how to apply for green card'. It certainly isn't a quick process, but with some tenacity and patience, you'll navigate through it. Remember, the wait is often worth the reward. 

## Further Information

Make sure to reach out to U.S. citizen and Immigration Services to get current information about application fees, where to submit applications, and any other specific details you might need for your specific application.

Becoming a permanent resident of the USA is a rewarding journey. We hope this post gave you a comprehensive insight on "how to apply for a green card". The lights of American cities are shining, and they are waiting for you to join them. Good luck on your journey!
