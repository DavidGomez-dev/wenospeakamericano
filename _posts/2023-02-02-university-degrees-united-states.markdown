The university careers are at the level of Undergraduate Studies, and in the United States they refer to them as Bachelor Degree.A bachelor Degree is a degree race or, what was previously called, a bachelor's degree or diploma, and lasts approximately four years (in the case of Europe it is completed in three years). In order to request a place in this type of programs, the main requirement is to have finished high school studies. There are two types of Bachelor Degrees, Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science:

### B.A.(Bachelor of Arts):

It is called Bachelor of Arts because it refers to careers more related to the world of letters, fine arts and humanities, although sometimes some other science careers such as biology are within the title "Bachelor of Arts". The difference between Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science lies at the level of complication and study area. In general, the races of B.S. They are more complicated and demand a greater number of subjects studied than in the B.A. This type of degree or bachelor is considered undergraduate, and will require specialization to finish them. This specialization is the so -called minor.

### B.S.(Bachelor of Science):

It is a degree career (previously equivalent to degree or diploma) that lasts approximately four years in the United States (three in Europe). It is called Bachelor of Sciences because it refers to careers more related to natural sciences, engineering, computer engineering or mathematics. The difference between Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science lies at the level of complication and study area.In general, the races of B.S. They are more complicated and demand a greater number of subjects studied than the B.A.This type of bachelor races are considered undergraduate, and will require specialization to end them. This specialization is the so -called minor. In the case of choosing to study a bachelor of science, it is important to know that they are not usually as structured as in Europe.That is, during the four years, the student is free to choose the subjects he wants, but at least more than half must be related to the scientific field.On the other hand, the student will choose a major and a minor during the studies.

At the time the student is accepted by a university, he sends documents to be completed to start with the visa application process. Thanks to this visa, international students can obtain a period of permission to legally work in the United States like any other American, once they finish their studies. This permission is called Opt (optional practical training).The employment permit period varies depending on the type of studies. In this sense, the maximum period of employment permit in the USA is 18 months.

Once the OPT is finished and expired, if the company decides to bet on the employee, it will be able to sponsor him to obtain an H1 visa that will allow him to remain in the country and work for 3 more years.

In the United States, salaries for people who carry out this type of studies, as soon as they are finished, vary from about $ 40,000 to about $ 85,000.
