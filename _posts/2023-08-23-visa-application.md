# The Definitive Guide to a Successful USA Visa Application

Visiting or migrating to the United States can be a dream come true for many. Turn that dream into reality by understanding the ins and outs of the **visa application** process.

## Understanding Visa Application

A _visa_ is a legal document that allows a person to enter a foreign country. The Department of State manages visa applications in the USA. Each year, millions of people apply for different types of visas to enter the United States.

### Applying for a Visa

The **application** process might seem daunting, but it's quite straightforward once you understand the steps. Let me guide you through the process.

#### Step 1: Identify Your Visa Type

Different circumstances demand different types of visas. The two main categories are immigrant visas (for those intending to live in the USA permanently) and nonimmigrant visas (for temporary stays).

#### Step 2: Complete the Application Form

Form DS-160, Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application or Form DS-260, Online Immigrant Visa Application needs to be filled based on the visa category. Ensure all the information provided is accurate.

#### Step 3: Schedule Your Interview

Visa applicants, especially those seeking nonimmigrant visa categories, need to schedule an interview. The interview usually takes place at the Embassy or Consulate in your country.

#### Step 4: Prepare for Your Interview

Having all your documents is key to a successful **visa application**. These documents include your passport, DS-160 or DS-260 confirmation page, application fee payment receipt, and photo (if you didn't upload one while filling the application).

#### Step 5: Attend Your Visa Interview

A consular officer will conduct the interview and determine your eligibility to receive a visa.
